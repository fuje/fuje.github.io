                <p>Hi there!</p>
                <p>My name is Guilherme Fujiyoshi. I'm a 24 years old boy who lives in Curitiba, Brazil. </p>
                <p>When I was still a teenager (13-14 years old), I attempted to create my first web page. Although it doesn't worked as I expected at that time, that was enough to get me introduced in the programming world.</p>
                <p>When I was 17 years old, I decided to take the bachelor in Information Systems course at the Federal University of Technology - Paran√°, where I occasionally got graduated.</p>
                <p>Nowadays I work full-time as a full stack developer. Actually, I work as little as possible on the back-end side, but sometimes I have to get my hands dirty!</p>
                <p>I love my career, but besides that I love other things too! Whenever possible, I like to play games (classic programmer), play my guitars or hang out with my friends.</p>
                <p>Now, I'll stop with the cheap talk (yes, I love that too!). In the following sections you can find more information about me (the relevant ones, I'd say).</p>
